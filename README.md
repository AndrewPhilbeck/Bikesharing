# Analysis of bike-sharing in New York City, New York

Analysis of Citi Bike, a bike-sharing program in New York City for use in proposal of similar program in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Overview

While New York City and Des Moines differ in a variety I wanted to look at aspects of the New York Citi Bike program that were not unique to the area so that we could see what aspects of this program would most likely translate to a similar program in Des Moines. The data has all been collected from August of 2019.

## Results of Analysis

### Basic Information Breakdown

Here are three visualizations which provide some basic information about the New York Citi Bike program in August of 2019

This gives us the total number of rides for the month: 2,344,224.

We also see that the users of Citi Bike are mostly subscribers to the program and not primarily customers. This is significant because it means that Citi Bike has been built into their budget and they count on Citi Bike for essential use and not just opportunistic trips. 

We are also given a breakdown of Gender and see that most of the users are Male.

### Checkout Times for Users 

These next two visualizations provide what I believe to be very beneficial information in regards to the potential of a Citi Bike program in Des Moines. This is because we see below the breakdown of how much time user’s checkout bikes on average for the month of August. The first image is for all the customers who used Citi Bike, the second image has the same information broken down by gender.

The reason I believe this is beneficial for us is because it shows that the vast majority of Citi Bike users are on their bikes for less than twenty minutes. This means that even in a city the size of New York they are not using the bikes for long trips. One of the reasons I believe a Citi Bike program would work in Des Moise is because even though it is much smaller the majority of people will only be using the bikes for twenty minutes or less like we see in the New York City data.

### Per Hour Trips by Day of the Week

This image gives us basic information about who uses the bikes most on certain days of the week. It confirms other information we have already seen (The majority of users are males who subscribe to the Citi Bike program) but it helps us see more clearly who are target demographic is and how we should market this program to them 

_Males who can use Citi Bike to travel to and from work_

The above image confirms this by showing the majority of bike trips take place at 8am and 5-6pm on Monday through Friday. People are using them to go to and from work. There is also significant use taking place between 9am & 7pm on Saturday and Sunday. _Oddly people don’t seem to use the bikes to travel home on Wednesday._

This final image shows us not simply the trends of which hours of the day Citi Bike is used but shows us a breakdown of how many are used. On the one hand it confirms what we have seen in other visualizations but it offers us a better picture of the number of bikes available in New York City. This will be helpful when doing further analysis of the number of bikes needed for a Citi Bike program in Des Moines.

## Summary of Analysis

Looking at a snapshot of information about Citi Bike (_August of 2019 in New York City_) encourages me on the possibility of a similar program working in Des Moines. There is still more work to be done however. I recommend more demographic based analysis on New York City vs. Des Moines. If the majority of Citi Bike users are professionals who live in the city and use the bikes for commuter purposes we need to find out as best we can how many professionals live in Des Moines. We also need to do similar analysis to what was just completed but rather than a snap shot (one month) we need an annual picture of how Citi Bike is used in New York. Once these are complete, we can begin to look at the financial aspects of the program and answer questions about cost of bikes, cost of bike maintenance, cost for subscribers and cost for customers among others.
